# About technologies
I used kaychain to save user id, simulating if i have to save a token or other important data, i used realm to save user data (User infor and favorite series), i used MVVM architecture pattern with combine to use the bestpractices.
I used SwiftUI to get the best UI posible, but i can use UIKit and storyboards too.
